    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Overview</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Purpose</h3>
    <p>The objective is to navigate downstream rivers rapids using an inflated raft. It's considered an extreme sport which is highly challenging and risky and requires a lot of technical skills and teamwork. The races are conducted on river courses. Usually, sprint and slalom events are conducted for rafting.</p>
    <p>Adrenaline rushes allow rafters to focus only on the excitement they feel rather than the physical exercise of rafting. Reduces stress – Rafting provides you an escape from reality. The quietness of nature lets you relax and leave all your worries behind you, especially when the river is slow-moving.</p>
